I couldn't take it anymore so I visited my dermatologist and he prescribed me Ziana gel. For the first week you will only use it every other day to get your skin use to it. After the first week use it just before bed. Do not use it until nighttime because the gel oxidizes with sun exposure. Your skill will only be oily for a few months and it helps w/ dark spots.

Another thing...just use vaseline as a moisturizer...why should you bother your skin with extra chemicals? Also be wary of doctors who just hand you the retinol with no proper instructions.

My mental state has never felt better than being on this pill. However I'm having way worse of physical side affects now than on my old pill. Intercourse is extremely painful even putting in a tampon feels like it\u2019s burning. I never had this issue before. It\u2019s also made my acne worse than ever (I get hormonal acne easily). On the plus side it hasn\u2019t made me gain any weight. If you\u2019re using this pill for reasons other than a birth control it\u2019s great. However if you\u2019re using it to have unprotected sex then it\u2019s kind of pointless because sex has become so painful and it lowers your libido too. However every person is different so what doesn\u2019t work for me might work for you.", "label": 2}

Up until recently after being off Vivarin for about a year I decided to buy a box and noticed that a different company (I guess) had taken over the rights for Vivarin? Box looks different but still gets me slightly stimulated. 5 years ago I would have given it a 7/10 but now it gets a 5/10 since it barely even works. After a year of being caffeine free lol. Pros are it gets you very much physically stimulated turns on your peripheral nervous system fatigue is reduced metabolism is at full-speed and has a subtle good feeling similar to Adderall but it's honestly kinda poopy.

{"text": "I was constipated for a little over a week. I took milk of magnesia and miralax but neither worked. So I did an oil enema and that too did not work. Eventually my moms coworker told me to take magnesium citrate so I go to Publix and get their lemon one. I read reviews before taking it to see what I was getting myself into. I took 1/2 of the bottle and the taste was bad but bearable. I was expecting something to happen within a few hours but all that happened was extreme nausea. The next morning I woke up with the urge to go so I go to the bathroom and I basically peed out of my anus. That happened 3/4 times within an hour but after that it stopped. I could tell I was still backed up so we did another enema this time a saline one. The second I pulled out the nozzle I ran to the toilet and oh my .. the relief is insane. I recommend this product and if you want instant relief use an enema with it as well", "label": 1}

Interestingly I almost feel an odd combination of light-headedness and euphoria. It does seem to affect my sleep making me wake once or twice a night. The first day I started it I went to the gym and got VERY lightheaded between lifts. Then in the sauna I was literally dripping like a wrung towel which made me nervous and I left.

I have never been so sick in so many different ways at one time. 2 weeks after finishing this awful cocktail I am still experiencing side effects. The only good thing is I no longer feel like I'm sucking on a penny. And it did work on my diverticulitis. I can honestly say the cure was worse than the disease. Pretty much the worst experience in an antibiotic I've ever had. What doesn't kill you makes you stronger???? This group of meds is dangerous.", "label": 1}
{"text": "This was the first medication I was prescribed for anxiety panic attacks post traumatic stress disorder and a few other problems I had going on at the same time. I started taking 1mg once per day then 1mg twice per day... this worked well for quite a while. Then I changed to 2mg once per day and after several months went to 2mg twice per day. I took this for about 4yrs. total and had no nightmares seldom had racing thoughts the panic attacks stopped pretty much all together after the first week or two and this also kept the general anxiety at bay as well. The only problem was that if you have no insurance or discount card it's very expensive!
