I had been taking generic Yaz birth control for a while and my gynecologist switched me to Slynd because of my endometriosis and it has been good so far since I did not like norethindrone in the past. I have had painful recurring ovarian cysts for years. Then my doctor added Orilissa and I was like 'Yay finally some relief.' Keep in mind; I have bipolar disorder and CPTSD and I am on the autism spectrum. I was horrified when I looked it up and saw the effects it had on other women especially those who already had conditions like bipolar disorder. I took it for four days and while it helped my cramps I was a raging monster to my husband. I hated that. My gynecologist thought I would be okay since I am on a good mood stabilizer but sadly no. My pharmacist said she thinks it was this medication. I am so disappointed; I wanted this to work for me!", "label": 0}

It helps my concentration and ADHD issues for maybe the first 2 hours or less after each dose but then from there it causes terrible anxiety depression. It makes things worse than actually helping when it starts wearing off (which is very quickly). Overall I don't like Focalin at all. It not only comes with mental side effects like I mentioned but also physical side effects as well such as: shortness of breath rapid heart beat constant feeling like I have to urinate but can\u2019t fatigue etc. It\u2019s been over 3 months and it hasn\u2019t helped my ADHD consistently or effectively anywhere close to stabilizing and treating it. Please consider other ADHD meds before going with Focalin for you / your child\u2019s ADHD problems. It certainly hasn\u2019t been the answer for me.", "label": 0}

But within a month I put on 14 pounds and that was completely unacceptable. I went off Remeron immediately with no withdrawal symptoms.

I usually switch from my left/right side of my abdomen to hide it under my pants each week for 3 weeks and then remove it for my off week (my period.) It's easier knowing when I am going to start by using the stickers that come in the box each month I am able to apply to my home calendar that no one sees (then there are stickers you place on the patch so the third patch you know to call in your refill.) It's a good system but I sometimes start my period in the middle of my third patch instead of my off week. My libido is down somewhat. Doesn't always stay stuck to my body (scary.)", "label": 2}

{"text": "Euthyrox was given to me by my Walmart pharmacy instead of my regularly prescribed generic levothyroxine about 1.5 years ago. When I questioned the difference in the med the pharmacy clerk said it was a new levothyroxine and that it was identical to my previous prescription (the pharmacist never explained anything to me). Since then my thyroid levels have been way off my PCP kept changing the dosage thinking it would help level things off. After doing online research and discussing with my physician at length we figured out that the changes to my levels was due to this medication. She immediately switched me back to levothyroxine but I also had to switch pharmacies as Walmart Pharmacy only dispenses Euthyrox for levothyroxine. Seems like a deal was made with the Pharma company!!! This makes no sense and it\u2019s very dangerous for Walmart to be making a decision for patients that could eventually be detrimental to their health. Bad business Walmart!

I exercise regularly and eat fairly well. I became strict with my diet tracking every single calorie to see if that would help and it hasn't. At night I often find myself agonizing over how insanely hungry I am and I know its this pill! I'm giving it a couple more months but I have a feeling I'll go back off of it. Last time I was on it I was carrying around 30 lbs of extra weight and as soon as I stopped the pill the lbs literally started to vanishing.
