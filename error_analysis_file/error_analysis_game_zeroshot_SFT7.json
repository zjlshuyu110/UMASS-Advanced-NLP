    "text": "If you have any love for the classic side scrolling Beat-em-Up's of Capcom's glorious back catalog then this is for you. Boasting a perfect version of the arcade game you find yourself picking a classic D & D archetype and battling wave after wave of classic enemies before a boss. Wash, rinse, repeat. Throw in some light RPG mechanics and loot and you have a game that is a little bit more then Final Fight with Magic. Speaking of Magic, it is marginally annoying as a melee player to constantly have the action frozen by the spell-casters, but it's little more than a mild inconvenience. The online features bring 4 player drop and drop out action, much like playing in an arcade back in the day. Achievements and challenge goals add to the feature set. For your £12 you get a lot of old school fun in a nice package. Your mileage with this game will probably vary wildly with your age. If you have never set foot in an arcade then skip it, but if you spent your formative years feeding Final Fight, Double Dragon and others with coins then this is money well spent. Remember to turn off the filters though, they make the core game look hideous. Stick with the classic sprites.",

    "text": "The best GTA since San Andreas. The city of Los Santos is an incredible place, and is really the greatest world ever created in a game. But GTA IV had a great story, and that is what is lacking in GTA V. I felt that the story was a bit forced, as when Michael destroys the home of tennis coach and eventually gets back to the assaults to make money, and from there the story involves well, but I really did not like the beginning and the end of the game actually, I hope they come up with a better ending next time, it was not bad, but it was nothing special either. The multiplayer is really good, but it constantly failing, but is actually a multiplayer that has never been done in any GTA game. Rockstar promised varied activities, but still does not reach the point of San Andreas, and even when we go out with friends, there is almost nothing to do with them. Overall I think it's the second best GTA game, and for me I would place it in number four on my list of Game of the Year 2013.",

The perk card system is a poor replacement on the previous perk system. The gun modification system has been greatly dumbed-down and is more irrelevant. The CAMP feature is not fun, uncreative, and rage inducing. The story and quests are actually not there and more shallow than what one would think at first look. And the community is toxic, hostile, and overall what a racist white male community typically is like. Theres room for things to be worse of course, but I cannot see how.

    "text": "I do have to say that in general; I have grown to dislike the Call Of Duty franchise. I was a big fan of COD4 and liked MW2 at the time, but the series's knack for regurgitating the same formula on me every year made me start to move away and play better things (Battlefield?). I have no time at all for the Treyarch entries and never have done but I've always been curious about what the next Modern Warfare game would be like (although I expected virtually nothing new at all). I expected to hate it, then somebody bought it for me as a Christmas present. I just finished the campaign and I have to say that even though it still feels like Call Of Duty 4 (in every single way), I was somewhat satisfied with it. I enjoyed how the story continued from the previous games and it helped me kill a few hours. However I have to say that the multiplayer is exactly what I expected and worse; a montage of complete chaos; requiring virtually zero skill, poor (and repetitive) voiceovers, yet more messy killstreak (or 'pointstreak') rewards and pathetically dated animation (try and watch another player sprint, without laughing out loud). In general it feels like the multiplayer experience has gone backwards since COD4, if anything. Activision need to learn that improving on a game's multiplayer does not just mean adding extra things to the previous year's game. It requires new modes, new features, new challenges, new possibilities and in this case; a completely new engine (how they are still getting away with using the COD4 engine is beyond me). On the whole, there is SOMETHING enjoyable about MW3. Is it worth the hype that gaming publications have given it? -No. Is it worth the ridiculously high scores that gaming publications have given it? -Absolutely not. Is it worth a user score on 3.2 here on Metacritic? -Perhaps. Does this franchise need to be rebuilt from scratch? -Absolutely. I'm giving this a 5.0 because the campaign was indeed fun for me, but if not for that then I would be giving this a 0. It's nothing more than an expansion pack and I would have indeed been hugely disappointed if I had invested Â£40 in this game, just to find out that I had received an expansion pack for a very old game (CO4). Activision and their subsidiaries need to hear the message and hear it clear; 'START CREATING VIDEO GAMES AGAIN AND STOP COPYING AND PASTING THE PREVIOUS GAME EACH AND EVERY YEAR. IMPRESS US AGAIN, LIKE YOU DID WITH CALL OF DUTY 4. SHOW US THAT YOU CAN STILL PRODUCE A FRESH AND ORIGINAL TITLE'. That is all. 5.0.",

    "text": "I love this kind of games and I have to admit that I was eager to buy the Game for the Switch after reading and watching reviews. I did buy it on a massive discount for just $2 instead of some $20 and boy am I glad I did not pay full price. I think this game has some great Ideas in terms of Story and the idea to add some text adventure style game play but it fails in some other areas. If you're characters are in a confined space such as a House, it is very hard to actually see where you can move and still have cover. Moving around the camera is often not helpful at all. Either a fully free moving camera or a Zoom would have been awesome. You certainly could get past the Camera issue if the game would be a bit more fair. You quite often place your character in a position with cover and with a pretty much clean sight to the Enemy (no table, chairs or anything in between, yet you only get a 50% hit chance. Other times your enemy is on the second floor and with you directly beneath and you get a 100% hit chance. Or you decide to rush a room, move in with the enemy right in front of you, you can shoot and you WILL miss... why ?? That does not make ANY sense at all. Hard West could have been a very good release for the Switch, I like the ideas, the graphic, the theme.... but, in my opinion, the Developer messed it up. I would have been mad if I payed full price but for $2.... it is essentially just like a spilled Coffee. Even though I really WANT to like the game, I just can't. If this game is on Sales in your region for under $10 you may want to have a look otherwise stay clear. Hopefully XCOM will fare better on the switch than Hard West.",

    "text": "I have never been a fan of combat flight simulation video games, and Ace Combat: Assault Horizon was the only other title I had played before Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown. Despite my disappointment with the previous installment, the overwhelming praise from the franchise's fans convinced me to give this one a try, even purchasing it at its launch. Let's start with the story. Although it is a significant improvement over Assault Horizon, it fell short of my expectations. The narrative had its moments and introduced interesting characters, but I found it to be oddly told, leaving me somewhat disconnected from the events unfolding. The constant references to states, places, and various elements left me confused most of the time, and I struggled to comprehend the motivations of different parties involved. While my lack of familiarity with the previous games might have contributed to this, I believe the game should accommodate newcomers as well, especially since it's only the second title in the series to have a PC release. Furthermore, the lack of a visible protagonist, their silence, and lack of personality made it difficult to fully immerse myself in the story. The one-sided radio communications, where other characters interact with the silent protagonist, didn't sit well with me, as I prefer more engaging interactions in games. To clarify, I don't mean to say that the story is bad, but it could have been executed better. On a positive note, the cinematics were well-done and added to the overall experience. Moving on to the graphics, they are undeniably stunning. The game boasts beautiful scenery, an amazing sky, and impressive effects. However, I couldn't help but feel a bit let down by the ground terrain textures, which seemed low-resolution in comparison to the other aspects of the game. Now, onto the gameplay, which I can confidently say was perfect this time. Despite my initial disinterest in this genre, I had an absolute blast playing Ace Combat 7. The sense of accomplishment from successful kills was incredibly rewarding, and I thoroughly enjoyed the controls and flying mechanics, finding them to be smooth and responsive. This held true for both singleplayer and multiplayer modes. While I don't envision spending an extensive amount of time in the multiplayer aspect, I can understand why many players would be drawn to it. In conclusion, Ace Combat 7: Skies Unknown proved to be an enjoyable experience for me, despite my reservations about the story and certain graphical aspects. The exceptional gameplay ultimately won me over, turning me into a fan of the franchise. If you're willing to overlook the minor shortcomings and are seeking a thrilling flight combat experience, this game is undoubtedly worth playing.",

The customization is nice and keeps the game fresh and it seems like they'll keep supporting it with patches and downloadable content. The reason as to why it's only worth an 8 is because of the graphics. I'm never one to be picky with how a game looks as long as it's enjoyable and CTR is mostly that, but in handheld mode, the game can be quite difficult to look at. Adding to that, the load times can be unbearable. But apart from that, you have many modes to race in, local and online multiplayer and a great time ahead of you.

    "text": "Minor spoilers; no details. Pokemon Sword and Shield feel like the incomplete beta of a really good game. I mean that in both a technical and a design sense. These games are fun to play through, no doubt. But most of what's ultimately fun about these games are the basic mechanics that have made up the Pokemon franchise for 20 years. When you look at everything these games do that doesn't fall back on \"being Pokemon\" you're left with a very half-baked array of good ideas that feel like they weren't given the polish or thought they needed to really shine. First of all, the elephant in the room: these games suffer on a technical level. Badly. I honestly cannot understand the constant defenses these games have received in terms of \"who cares about that\" when talking about frequent and incredibly visible graphical bugs that one would expect out of a demo, not a triple A release. In my playthrough I encountered dozens of cases where the games glitched visually or just lacked in aesthetic polish. And that's only to speak of the GRAPHICAL problems. These games actively lag, especially in the Wild Area. Their framerate varies from \"perfectly fine\" to \"genuinely unplayable\" based on a lot of circumstances, including what video output I used. But the technical shortcomings aren't the only ways in which these games feel incomplete. The Wild Area is an incredibly promising new mechanic that makes it fun to explore and discover new Pokemon. But after the initial magic of it wears of you start to realize that it is actually rather small and that there is very little to really \"explore\". You can find various items lying about on the ground, and of course different patches of grass feature different Pokemon, but that's about it. The Pokemon just exist, wandering endlessly in circles and leaving you with little real interactivity besides running into them to battle if you want. You can't even experience the joy of seeing something exciting off in the distance and journeying over to discover it because the render distance is absolutely pitiful. The Wild Area is a big step in the right direction, but it would benefit greatly from Pokemon being a bit more natural rather than just all popping into existence and wandering in circles. The Wild Area is a concept that invokes our imaginations of a wide open area full of Pokemon living and waiting to be discovered, but ultimately its execution is effectively a big space with a controllable camera and the overworld Pokemon mechanics from Pokemon Let's Go. The raids featured here are similarly fun at first, but start to become very frustrating when you begin to take on higher level ones. The NPC partners you can team up with border on sabotaging you at times with ridiculous sets and terrible Pokemon choices for the raid, meaning high-tier raids are really only fun with human partners. Waiting for human partners takes a while and requires you to pay for Nintendo Switch Online. The Galar region is genuinely gorgeous and I commend the team on the aesthetic design. However, it's just that: a gorgeous setpiece. The game consistently places superficial barriers in your way to make sure you stay in very tight designated \"play areas\" which often leave you no room whatsoever to explore the environments. They're pretty backdrops but don't feel like real places because you're given no room to explore them. There is one town late in the game in which the Pokemon Center is literally the only building you can enter. Routes are similar in that despite there only being 10 of them only about 3 of the routes in the game actually feature any level of exploration or depth. Most of the routes are simply straight lines from point A to point B with no real exploration available. When you couple this with the constant interruptions for large chunks of NPC dialogue you begin to spend the entire game feeling like you're on rails. And the NPC dialogue interruptions really are a problem. The games feature a whole host of characters almost all of which ultimately never end up being relevant. Sonia spends the entire game trying to crack a mystery that is blatantly obvious to anyone who has seen the game's box art. Hop interrupts you in virtually every route and town yet almost never says anything of any importance to you. Bede and Marnie were the bearable rivals because they were more conservative with their interruptions, but both ultimately end up being of minimal importance in the grand scheme of things. Bede's story is entirely self-contained and Marnie's doesn't really culminate in any character growth for anyone involved. Despite the game interrupting you non-stop for exposition throughout its entire playtime, the actual plot climax comes out of the left-field with no buildup and resolves in under an hour. The rushed plotpoints don't make a lot of sense in the bigger picture and left me genuinely scratching my head trying to understand certain characters' motivations.",

Fort Tarsis felt like a crypt instead of a main hub and the inability to run through it was infuriating. My playthrough quickly turned into: \"let's pick the dialogue option that appears to be the shortest so i can get back to playing.\" Combat did become repetitive rather quickly and the lack of life in the world did not help the matter. I cannot help but look at the E3 trailer's world and compare that to the world that was delivered and i keep thinking that I would much rather be playing on that map.

OK - if you love the series, you know this game is just like all the others. It's super formulaic now. It tries to come off as free world but the side quests and challenges aren't interesting - they get old quick. I get that this game tried to focus a bit more on the Batmobile and that's fun but now you have to use the Batmobile to get this done or get that done. I mean, timing your roof top jumps in the Batmobile was kinda like the jump the shark moment for me when I realized that Rocksteady was just grasping at straws here. So here's the problem I see for the franchise and any potential upcoming games - if we don't, as fans, let the developers know that we demand more from our games, we won't get more. These games are all the same - let's be honest - the combat, the story, the gadgets - it's like a bunch of DLC released as new games. Like I said, I love Batman and I've enjoyed the series but I'm hoping to see a fresh reboot.",

    "text": "FF15 is **** game. I'd probably rate the first half at around an 8. Sure, it's flawed, but there's enough neat things going on that it's overall a slightly above average experience. The second half of the game, however, is just lazy, rushed, terrible gameplay with no redeeming qualities. You basically run through dark hallways constantly re-using the same textures and enemies by yourself, because the MC Noctis got separated from his bros. It's not fun. For the half of the game that is fun, it's not great, just good. You have an illusion of a big world to explore, but if you go off the beaten path for even a moment you will run into invisible walls and such. You are not meant to explore this world, but stick to the main paths. The combat, honestly, is pretty bad in comparison to some rival RPGs, so that wouldn't be a big draw to keep me interested in the game. The fishing minigame is not very well done... it just kinda... blah in most of the things it attempts to do. For instance, there's this big emphasis on the car. Is it fun to drive the car? Nope. It pretty much drives itself. SO WHY? It's my opinion that the best games have a gameplay first mindset, but this game just makes how things look the priority. Why can't I jump on top of the hood of a car? There's an invisible wall there. Plastic lawn chairs are like cemented down, and can't be moved. The day to night cycle is so fast you can't do much before nightfall. You know what? Actually it's not half a \"good\" game, it's half a mediocre one. That makes it about a 3/10 by my math. Don't buy this thing for full price.",

Most of the chat options provide a false sense of choice as the options have little to do with what Shepard will say.

Graphics are subpar and look reminiscent of Mass Effect 2. Bugs out the ass with regards to graphics and in some aspects of gameplay.

    "text": "A lot of things has changed in Aion, since I started to play 8 years ago. And let's be honest.. Gameforge completely wasted this game and changed Aion into their another, money digging MMO with restrictions and empty servers. Shame on you, Gameforge for ruining Aion in Europe. NCSoft NA version, is the only one I can recommend (beside Korean). What you should know before joining Aion and what changed during 8 years: For now Siel is the most populated server, followed by Israphel. Plus I've heard rumors about server merging. Events happens basically every week or two. Every 10 levels, starting from level 5, you are getting free stuff, such as armors, weapons, wings or other useful items, which is a big help for newcomers. You can play without pvp till level 65 on fast-track server. After that you will be spending time struggling with your race enemies (beside arenas, sieges in Abyss, or battlefields earlier), so there's a lot of time to learn the basics. Maps on standard server are unfortunately empty, because most of players prefer to play on fast-track server. It might be a plus for some people, or minus for others. Everything is about new maps - Iluma (Elyos) and Norsvold (Asmodian). And while leveling till 65-66 might be easy, since 67-75 it takes months if you're not a hardcore player. ** Economy isn't really stable, mostly because of constant events, but many items have own stable price. You can get kinah (in-game currency) in many ways, such as: crafting (first you should learn prices and know what sells the best or what is desired), extracting armors from quests/selling coins/manastones/potions/or other tradeable stuff from quests/grinding, events, participating in Taki's mission and collecting crystals then crafting items in Luna Shop or by finding your own sugar daddy. Yes- you will need a lot of kinah if you dont want to be a training dummy in PvP. ** It's not hard to find a party for popular instances such as early (or endgame) ADMA or THEO, ORB, DR, Sauro, Upper Abyss Barracks or camp-switching runs in Levinshor and many other. Many new instances has been added. Many of them are pretty challenging, because rewards will make you a billionaire. ** There's no queues anymore.. You don't have to buy additional content, everything is unlocked. You are not forced to buy items from cash shop, since, as you can read above, there's a lot of possibilities to make kinah. You dont have to grind coins anymore (plat, gold, silver, bronze) for weeks to get a gear. You can shapeshift into one of four elements now - Fire, Water, Wind or Earth, thanks to new essence system, available for Archdeavas. There's new crafting option for Archdeavas - Aetherforging. Plus A LOT OF NEGATIVE REVIEWS HERE ARE OUTDATED. If you decided to quit Aion from any reasons, give it another try. You won't regret it, since Aion have changed. For good, of course.",

    "text": "I never thought I'd see the day where I wanted to play a game that revolved around cleaning up dust particles, but nevertheless, here we are. They say never judge a book by it's cover. Well, never judge a video game by it's screenshots. For this game appeared to have it all, but managed to fall short. Let me start out by saying that I loved the art style though, along with the soundtrack. In fact, the soundtrack is probably the best part about 'Dustforce' and is exactly what you want in a platformer. As for the controls, they are nowhere near as bad as some of the people on here make them out to be, and personally I found them to be quite good. The only thing that stinks is how they make you assign the controller buttons yourself, as opposed to just having them preset for you. I wouldn't even dream of using a keyboard to play this game. As you may already know, this game was made with speedrunning in mind. Speedrunning is something I enjoy watching, but not performing, and had I known that beforehand, I would have skipped this game entirely. I mean, who makes a game specifically tailored for speedruns? Getting to the end of a level as quickly as possible? Where's the fun in that? No, I like to take my time, look around, really take in my surroundings. And besides, isn't the whole fun in speedrunning, coming up with the fastest method on your own? It just doesn't make much sense if you ask me. Aside from that, there's pretty much nothing else to do in this game but run from door to door playing level after level for the best time. No bosses, no enemies, just jumping from one platform to another, climbing wall after wall, sweeping up that dirty dust. There just doesn't feel like much of a reason to continue playing 'Dustforce' after an hour or two, unless you care about posting the highest scores for all to see. Which is basically where 99% of the incentive to continue playing comes from; the highest possible score. On the other hand, I can definitely see how people enjoy playing this game. Like I said, the soundtrack is great, the art style although simplistic, works quite well, and the controls are pretty good.",

The writing is so on the nose and lacks any nuance, this is the kind of dialogue you would expect to hear at a children's pantomime show though I doubt musings on the perils of a virtual reality existentialist crisis would make for great entertainment in practice, especially for them chilluns. I respect the fact that the team tried to do something different but Christ alive this is some weapons-grade pretentiousness.

One of the best things about previous elder scrolls games was the class system WHICH WAS COMPLETELY REMOVED, this is done so that the player can \"Play how they want to play\" this ANNIHILATES the role playing element of the game near completely, because your character can be good at literally everything. The story line is very simple, and full of very lackluster characters, the ending of the game was so anti-climatic as well this just irks me to no end. The graphics are mediocre on PC, but this is easily remedied by the 2k texture pack. Also the lack of character development and impactful choices is just truly appalling compared to previous games. The guilds this time around are also extremely dumbed down and lack luster with the exception of a couple good quests. Pros- Fun Combat Lots of customization improved stealth Werewolves AND Vampires OST Pretty big world Cons- Easy Lack of True Role playing Story Dumbed Down Guilds Casualized leveling Dragons are a worse \"Gate\" mechanic Overly rewards the player",

It's still a fun game, but online is pretty much dead and don't expect as much content as GTA 5. A lot of people also criticized the game for lacking in content in comparison to older GTA games such as San Andreas and how most missions involve shooting people and lacking variety. What made this game great however is how impressive Rockstar did to reboot the series and give it a new identity.

Everything bad that happens to them is at the hands of angry white men(they even throw in a \"this is why we need that wall\" line for good measure). Everything good that happens to them is at the hands of woke hipsters and rainbow hair colored SJWs. Having played 2 episodes until now, so far the Wokeness in Episode 1 had been CRINGE level, while in Episode 2 we did get some story, some. It's such a shame that games producers have veered away from just telling a good story, instead of force-feeding me woke SJW pandering. I mean, who was this game made for? The people who liked Life is Strange 1? No, though that's who probably ended up buying this. It's made for the blue hairs, people who don't support anything. I honestly don't think there's any spark here for fans of the first game(which I am myself).",

    "text": "I will have to go with \"not recommend\" for the simple fact that I did not have fun with this game, its story elements annoyed the hell out of me, they made very little sense and gave me a bad experience. I only finished the game so the 60 euros I paid would not be wasted, otherwise I wanted to stop after 35% completion. Maybe the only positive things about the game is that it looks amazing and the voice acting is very good. The non-linear story makes everything seem so generic and repetitive and the flow of things on each region identical to one another. Some parts of the story are straight out of science fiction books and the best way Ubisoft knows how to raise the difficulty is to make enemies bullet sponges and throw any common sense out of the window. The game's ending goes WTF all the way and makes no sense at all. Again they defy logic just for that unexpected factor. Borrow this games from a friend, rent it or wait for a big sale but don't waste your money on the full price. While I did not encounter game breaking bugs there were quite a few like car hitting dead wolf and flying into the air, a very strange experience with a plane twerking in the air, teleporting instantly on the ground than taking off directly with no speed gain required, mission objective not being completed properly. In the beginning I had on average 55 FPS in 4K but the game kept complaining to update my graphics drivers. After the update it dropped 15 fps in 4K to 40 on average, even less and I was forced to play in 1080p.",

Yes, the graphics aren't as good as your xbone/ps4/pc when in docked mode, as it's essentially a PC port on low graphical settings. However this is a non-issue as it doesn't affect the gameplay at all, and in handheld mode you can't really see any noticeable difference between the different versions anyway. I have an xbox one but I still bought this game on switch as I don't get the opportunity to spend hours and hours playing in front of the TV at home anymore. I'd much rather play this game regularly on the go than rarely at home. On the downside, audio is reduced quality (but not so much that you'd notice), there is no special use of switch features such as gyro, the price is a little higher than I would have liked (Nintendo tax). However these are all minor issues when you consider the gameplay experience is essentially the same as you'd get on much more powerful consoles.

I played through the campaign on the Super soldier difficulty on my first playthrough and it was intense, the enemies detect you quicker and kill you much faster than on the lower difficulties. Playing on this difficulty helps the immersion because you are genuinely afraid of being detected during the missions, because even with your suit armor activated you don't last long against the enemy. You can approach missions from different routes and with different strategies which makes it pretty interesting. I completed the game playing as stealthy as possible, and now i'm going to go back through and use maximum armor only and just run and gun. The multiplayer is surprisingly fun, I really love the level of customization and the unlock system. I can't describe exactly what it is, the multiplayer just feels good to me.

The harder difficulties require from you quick reflexes, quick thinking and managing your resources which create a gameplay loop that is unlike any other. Even if the score might say otherwise, the game isn't perfect however. The story is embarrassingly awful, it has pointless platforming sections and some jarring invisible walls.

What a joke; more like towns or a nice summer hamlet. Can't even switch between these unimpressive stamp-sized villages without end-tasking the whole friggin game! No regional transportation? Transportation AI? AI in general? WTH? This is getting returned tomorrow morning. Thank God I didn't buy this online. If BB won't take it back, I'm contesting the charges on my CC. If EA wants to ban my Origin account then screw em, let em. I'm thinking I'm about done with EA anyhow.",

    "text": "A game I've been looking forward to for a while after coming across some impressive youtube videos of it that made crave being locked in a darkened room with just candle light flickering and my head phones on for an immersive horror fix. The controls are simple to learn to navigate around the asylum with a camcorder which you can alternate between standard mode and night vision for spookily hard to see areas (don't forget to set your gamma settings to low in game). Graphically the game is good and runs smoothly, NPCs are well modelled and look creepy but nothing to make you stop and say \"oh wow look at that\" so do not expect any eye candy, the camera modes are realistic and the grainy effect of night vision adds to the creepy atmosphere. Without giving much away the storyline is interesting as you gradually pick up research papers left around which are added to the journal and notes are added as the storyline progresses to each area. One criticism I have is the lack of environment interaction which I enjoy in some games, you are only able to pick research papers, open doors, jump and hide basically. It would of been nice also to of maybe have more of an investigative theme with (optional) hidden clues and puzzles to add more diversity to the game play. Like with most horror movies and games, sounds plays an important part in the overall immersiveness, Outlast manages to capture this effect to good use, though the droning high pitched sounds were slightly irritating after a while, saying that the sound effects are well placed and voice acting are very good. I did have a few jumpy moments and shocks primarily in the first hour of the game but then after I seem to become accustomed to the \"monsters\" running after me, having to sprint like mad and frantically try and find a place to hide. It took me around 5 hours to complete, I felt relativity satisfied that it's value for money though I doubt many people will want to play it through again, over all an enjoyable game and horror romp let down by one or two things that maybe could be improved on in a sequel. Pros Graphically spot on for a horror game, night vision mode is great, being in a creepy asylum is a scary experience, lots of frantic running and hiding with scary/jumpy moments. Cons Lack of environment interaction and exploration, no mod support, QTE (not a fan of them sorry). Not as intensely scary as I hoped for. Storyline 7/10 Graphics 8/10 Music, sounds & ambience 7/10 Voice acting 8/10 Gore 9/10 Scariness 6/10 Overall 7/10",

    "text": "EA could learn alot from Paradox Interactive. Paradox is community based and actually accepts criticisms from their consumers, and actually attempts to remedy situations. EA on the other hand gets defensive and blocks people who constructively criticize the game. Worse yet, EA has the audacity to not even watch sincere videos that demonstrate some of the major issues with the game. Then EA takes it further by calling \"anyone who criticizes the game a clown\". EA should be ashamed of themselves.",

    "text": "One of the most underrated games i have ever played. Asura's Wrath can be summed up in two words: an Epic Experience. If you are an anime fan of any sort, this is a must buy. This is one of the few games i can actually skip past the gameplay and get invested in the story. The story is just great. Everything is just so enthralling and engaging that you will feel engaged to the story from beginning to end. There are so many epic moments i can't count them all at the top of my head. The story is also pretty damn sad and tragic to the point that there were moments i started to tear up. The characters are well done. There is the extremely relatable and badass protagonist, the very cool anti-hero, the cool bad guy, emotional helpers to the hero and the bad guy you hate and they are all done well. The music is some of the best music i have ever heard in a video game. Wind Fang and Vajra Deus vs Vajra Asura alone are just two examples of how great this soundtrack is and it makes every scene even more epic than it usually is. I honestly don't know why this game got hate from reviews. If you know you are going to experience more of an anime instead ****, why hate on it. Every single aspect of this game is done extremely well. If The Walking Dead did it and got away with it, why can't Asura's Wrath? However, this is a game that you need to play for yourself to see if you like the game or not. I highly recommend this game to anyone interested in a literal \"epic\".",

    "text": "This game gives you very little to relax and frankly that's ok because how can you relax when you're a treasure hunter. And what a treasure hunter Drake is he(you) is well equipped to do pretty much anything; from fighting, to leaping, to solving puzzles. The only thing that Drake can't do is take on a lot of bullets; so cover is a major thing in this game, which gives it a huge realistic feel. Drake's agility can be used during combat but it mostly shines during platforming sections and a thrilling chase. The only time where Drake can relax a bit is during the puzzle sections of the game; they are not as entertaining as the combat but they do present their own buckets of charm. Although these sections are slower this is not to say that uncharted is a slow game; exactly the opposite. The pace of this game is incredible. All of this is complemented by the breath-taking sites you encounter...this must be one of the best looking games of all time. After finishing the campaign you would definitely want some more and there is plenty. One definite more is the three-player cooperative mode, which is highly recommended if you have a couple of friends. The competitive multiplayer is also a must which provides explosive action and the same great core gameplay and the great visuals. All-in-all uncharted 2 is a complete package and a must play for anyone who has a ps3.",

The character creator has a plethora of options, yet somehow fails to allow customization options that reflect 80% of most fiction and non-fictional beings.

End of the day, your choices have minimal impact and the negatives mentioned above never allow you to feel present in this fictional world. Another miss in 2024.",
