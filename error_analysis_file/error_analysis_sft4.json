I raised it to 60mg a day and seemed to get more tired and less motivated to get anything done. Finally I went to 80mg and still no help with focus. I just found that I was lethargic unmotivated and tired. I took naps and lazed around but didn't get as excited about things as I had before the medicine. My job requires creativity and it's hard to be creative if you're not excited about it. So I actually became LESS productive.",

I took the first dose right away and the blisters seem to have flattened out already. I will take the second dose tonight. I hope by morning they are mostly cleared up or at least they clear up before Saturday as I have big events going on this coming weekend.

Sadly after the extreme pain and horrible feeling both shots did not work requiring a shock to the heart with no sedation... I had an audience of 4 paramedics and a handful of nurses plus a couple of doctors but the doctor in command was the one who did the harm and was fired for malpractice less than 12 months later. Sadly no one stood up to say hey let's at least give him some Valium or something... Luckily now I carry Flecainide to sort the heart out. It sorts it out before I even get to the hospital as I live 30 minutes out of town. But if it does continue and not get back into normal rhythm they give me Verapamil now (an old-fashioned drug). That works the same as Adenosine but with no side effects.",

Before taking Lo Loestrin I had irregular week long periods with extremely heavy bleeding (to the point where I used 4/5 super tampons a day) and horrible cramps. I have been on the pill for 2.5 months now and absolutely love it. I spotted on and off for the first 2 months which is normal and tolerable. Other than that my period has been really light and has not lasted more than 3/4 days. I did experience some nausea at the beginning and have perhaps been more emotional than normal. Overall while there may be mild side effects they are completely outweighed by how much less miserable my periods have become.
