    "text": "Anthem is an entertaining and delightful experience the first couple hours. Flying feels great and the combat was very interesting. Unfortunately, the thrill of flying was surpassed by the boredom that the world and narrative inspired within me. I could not have cared less about the plot and only a handful of NPC's made me care about what they were telling me. Fort Tarsis felt like a crypt instead of a main hub and the inability to run through it was infuriating. My playthrough quickly turned into: \"let's pick the dialogue option that appears to be the shortest so i can get back to playing.\" Combat did become repetitive rather quickly and the lack of life in the world did not help the matter. I cannot help but look at the E3 trailer's world and compare that to the world that was delivered and i keep thinking that I would much rather be playing on that map. The one we received feels like it could have been procedurally generated since it looks barren, identical, and poorly crafted. I enjoy Warframe, Destiny, and the division and hoped to add this to my stable of favorite games but sadly that will not be the case. Here's to hoping they fix the majority of the problems in the next year or two.",

    "text": "I've been playing PUBG for several years now and it is one of the most annoying games 95% of the time and the last 5% it is one of the most satisfying games I've ever played. There is no feeling like winning a solo game after your heart's been pounding for the last 10 minutes like you were running a marathon. But, when that's said there's the other 95% off the time. The game has the most inconsistent and bad gunplay I've ever experienced. At times you kill guys with 3 headshots on 3 shots and the next game with the same weapons and same attachments and so on, and you can't hit the broad side of a barn. Full Auto spray is completely unpredictable but then it isn't the SCAR-L AR had a BUG where after the first 5 shots flew all over the place it would have zero recoil and hit bullseye on the next 25-35 shots. The bullet drop from every weapon makes zero sense and it's impossible to predict where you're gonna hit when you are more than 50 meters away from your target. Loot is random though it tends to be better at places with a high concentration of buildings but that is no guarantee and that's the same thing with vehicles. There are games where there's no loot, no vehicles anywhere and the zone is as far away from you as possible. If you don't have a DMR or a SR in the end game your chances go from bad to slim and if you don't have at least a 4x scope it's close to impossible to win. The SKS hasn't hit where you aim for the entirety of the games existence. Vaulting took a year to implement so you didn't get stuck on 20 cm fences or died because you couldn't jump through a window. Armor ruins everything since you need so many rounds with an SMG or 5.56 chambered AR or SR to kill your opponents with lvl 3 armor and helmet while they one hit you with a SR because you \"only\" have a lvl 2 helmet. Physics when driving, especially on the motorcycles, is the worst I've seen in any game. Glitches and bugs still riddle the game on every map. There is a ton of cheaters and hackers playing the game. There are so many faults with initializing the menu, entering games and loading screens where you fail to connect. and last but not least the sound design is the worst I've ever experienced in any game. I have a really good headset and I have no clue where shoots are coming from when I'm fired upon no matter the weapon. the sound when you get hit is gonna cause someone tinnitus and I don't want a jump scar because someone hit me with a 9mm round in a game. at times you hear people coming from a mile away on foot and other times they run straight by you without a sound. I may sound like a salty player who never \"Got Good\" but I've won multiple games in every game mode and PUBG is not a very good game. It's better than the other battle royal games in style and design I think, so that's why I keep playing it but it has always been and still feels like a game that's not finished and never will be.",

    "text": "Alright, it's time to set some things straight. I've been playing Destiny 2 since its launch, and I own every DLC released for the game. However, I didn't play Destiny 1 extensively, skipping out on everything after Y1 in that game. This was mostly due to the console exclusivity back then, as I'm mostly a PC gamer. So, when Destiny 2 came out I know it was time to get back into it. I will try to list all the pros and cons I've experienced over the years in this game. Bear in mind I have logged well over 900 hrs into D2 according to wastedondestiny (Ironically I don't consider these hours wasted). Pros: -The game is gorgeous and runs well even with old i7 and dated 1070 @1440p 144 hz monitor. Optimized well. -Thorough graphics adjustments and field of view sliders -deep and intense lore and world-building if you're into that -There is SO MUCH TO DO in this game, it can almost be a considered a con for newcomers -Seasonal content keeps things fresh, while not happening so often that you feel guilty for taking a break (to check out other games) -Year 3 and Shadowkeep is on the horizon and looks better than ever -PC has in-game chat and clan / guild system. MMO-feeling -Plethora of PvE activities to fill all your alien-headshotting needs (and explosions, grenades, space magic) -Solid gearing system with transmogs on the horizon in shadowkeep (for the fashion endgame) -Clean and mostly easy to use menus. -The music and atmosphere is amazing -The movement and shooting systems are TOP NOTCH. Easily the snappiest 1st person shooter I've played. It just feels right. The cons: -The story is OKish at best, and at times very boring and cliche. -Loadtimes can be brutally long, even on SSD -As mentioned earlier, there can almost be too much to do. You can feel overwhelmed at first. As I understand, this will be streamlined a bit in shadowkeep. -The game can be very random at times concerning weapon and armor drops. You might get the item you want, but it has the wrong stats. This can be frustrating when there are few direct paths to the item you really want. Some people however might consider this a pro. -Mistmatch between community wants and Developer goals. This happens in all live service games eventually and is not exclusive to Destiny. -There is an ingame real life cash shop. It is purely cosmetic. However I do understand that some people are put off by \"the coolest things\" being behind a paywall. This is however very subjective. -The game has for the most part been balanced for both PvE and PvP in paralell. This means that things might get nerfed for PvE when they were only a problem in PvP (and vice versa). -PvP has been rather shallow for the last year. There are special events every now and then, but it feels rather stale after a while. If you're mostly into PvP I would not bother at this point. Finally, I would like to say that this game has been a great comfort to me over the last few years. Sure, it has it's bad sides. Yeah I was tired of it during curse of Osiris. But I always returned. It always served as a nice escape from everyday stress. I could always log on and shoot some badguys and get some sweet loot. Or I could be more of a sweat and team up with other guardians through bungie's looking for group website and do the harder dungeons and raids. It's all there for you if you want. I have recommended this game to all of my friends who are into looter shooters, rpg's and spacey sci fi stuff. All of them have liked it, but at times the content drought can get too much, or the main campaign is too long and you just wanna play with your friends. Hopefully this will get fixed in shadowkeep and \"new light\" when the base destiny 2 goes free to play. I am looking forward to seeing you all in the game. PS. I would like to add: if you asked me for a review of Destiny 2, 2 years ago I would probably have rated it a bit lower - maybe a 6 or 7. It has steadily climbed over the last year. Conversely, I would say that anyone that votes this game lower than a 5 at this point is basing their review on old facts and an old state of the game that is no longer representable.",

    "text": "Story: You play as Delsin Rowe, a guy who likes to do spray billboards and get in trouble with your brother Reggie. One day, you get smoke powers, and it becomes your responsibility to save your tribe from dying at the hands of Augustine's concrete daggers. The story is essentially you getting new powers to help you fight Augustine, and I enjoyed it. The story is well told through cut-scenes and dialogue through your phone. I thought the voice acting was great, especially from Troy Baker who voices Delsin. The writing was also really good with good dialogue going on between Delsin and his brother as well as with the other characters you meet along the way. I also thought the villain was a real b**ch (which is a good thing). The only problem I have with the story is that it was short. On normal difficulty, you can beat the story good or evil in about 12 hours, which is disappointing compared to the previous inFamous games. But overall, I still really enjoyed the story. 9/10 Gameplay: inFamous: Second Son is an action adventure game where you'll be getting and using new super as you play. There are 4 in total and all of them are fun to use. I won't spoil the 2 powers you get later, but I can say that Neon is one of my favorite powers to use as a hero. What's also great about all the powers is the way you travel around the decent sized Seattle. With smoke, you can dash forward or through air vents to get to rooftops faster, with neon you could run at fast speeds through the streets or up walls, with the 3rd power, you could glide far distances and use satellite dishes to boost your distance, and for the last power, you turn into a \"running tank\" basically. Each power has their own unique sets of upgrades, and switching between them is as easy as pressing on the touchpad when you're near a power source. In the fictional Seattle, you'll also be liberating all the districts from the D.U.P. (evil corporation). So you'll be eliminating D.U.P. headquarters, destroying spy drones, hidden cameras, secret agents, spray painting walls (with some clever art using the Dualshock 4's motion controls), and eventually, you'll perform a district showdown on one of their propaganda billboards. Going for 100% completion isn't hard, and getting all trophies isn't hard either. There's also a karma system where you can choose to be a hero or a villain. Both sides offer exclusive upgrades to your powers, exclusive missions, different dialogues, and different endings so there's some good reasons to replay the story and do the opposite side. Doing ALL of this should take about 20-24 hours to complete. However, the A.I. in this game isn't the smartest. I counted 8 different enemy types in the game, and the game mixes them up to try to make each fight feel different and challenging. If you're playing on expert difficulty, or if you **** at the game, you might feel overwhelmed and have to retreat to recharge health and return to the fight. Overall, the gameplay is better than the previous 2 inFamous games in my opinion. 9/10 Graphics: This is not only the best looking PS4 game out right now, but is also one of the best looking games on consoles now. The graphics look absolutely stunning due to great lighting, character models, particle effects, and map design. Another thing is that during my playthroughs, my game stayed running at 60fps with rarely any frame rate drops. THIS HOW A NEXT GEN GAME SHOULD LOOK (Titanfall). 10/10 Sound: The gun shots from your enemies sound great, but nothing special. The sound your powers make when using them, or recharging them is great. The games soundtrack is great, but nothing stands out other than the music that plays when you're spraying walls and that awesome Nirvana cover theme. 8/10 Multiplayer: There is none, and I'm disappointed that the user-generated missions that were in inFamous 2 were removed. No score. Overall: This is the PS4's 1st must have game. Great story, gameplay, gorgeous graphics, and great sound designs are my reasons for picking up this game. But, because of its short amount of content, I don't think this game is worth picking up a PS4 just to play it. But, if you already have a PS4, then get this game. Verdict: 9/10",

    "text": "When the SH2 remake was announced, I was apprehensive. Even if we hadn't been bombarded with horrible game after horrible game for \"modern audiences\" for the past ten years, there's still the problem that only Team Silent knew how to make a good Silent Hill game – god knows Konami tried and tried and tried.Turns out, Bloober Team's remake is a genuine love letter (no Mary pun intended) to the original, and for ten hours of playing it I honestly thought this would turn out to be to the original SH2 what the RE2 remake was to its original. (And I love both the original RE2 (and 1 and 3 and 4) and the REmake.)This remake's praises have been sung all over the place, and rightfully so. Allow me to concentrate on the negatives.Much like the original, SH2 oozes with atmosphere and incentivizes exploration, yet unlike the original, it makes running past enemies a much less viable option – they can cross large distances in a heartbeat and latch onto your heels for far longer. So if you want to explore, you need to fight every single enemy, and their number has multiplied. You used to fear there might be an enemy behind the next corner. (Which was necessary anyway because of the extremely limited enemy variety.) There's no fear involved when you KNOW there will be ****, I don't mind combat at all. I've put more than 400 hours into Dragon's Dogma 2 precisely BECAUSE the combat is so much fun, despite the lack of enemy variety. But you can't make every game revolve around combat this heavily. I didn't mind more enemies and more combat in general because I knew that that's a necessary concession to the expectations of the targeted mass market. But everything in moderation, and Bloober Team lost its steady hand when applying combat in the second half of the game which turns into the original's antithesis: a shooting gallery, a gauntlet of never-ending combat **** increase of combat encounters became apparent in the Woodside Apartments, more so in the Blue Creek Apartments, but not to an excessive degree, the game still kept combat at a happy medium, and after those you got a lengthy breather to build the atmosphere of dread and loneliness back up again, long stretches of exploration and storytelling with just a few enemies sprinkled in. Another hectic combat-heavy segment followed, but it was short, and you got a breather with the first ten minutes of Brookhaven Hospital, and the rest of it still stopped ever so short of being excessive. But the otherworldly Hospital cranked the combat up to eight where it should have been five at most, and after that it leveled out at nine, hardly let up, and mixed things up with ten. Make no mistake, this isn't purely psychological horror anymore, this is action horror. Whereas Silent Hill used to make damn sure it set itself apart from Resident Evil, it's become Resident Evil now. The original PS1 games were poles apart, but their second entries' remakes are birds of a feather. They're structured the same, they feel the same mechanically, they just have different paint jobs. Having to say this about franchises so different from each other – one that proudly reveled in its B movie silliness and one that tackled very mature and incredibly dark topics – hurts quite a bit. I realize this works just fine for most people, but for me, it lessens what SH2 was all about so incredibly much.Sparsely distributed encounters gave the original's atmosphere enough room to breathe, and with less than half a dozen enemy models in the whole game Team Silent wisely didn't overuse them. But when you turn SH2 into an action horror game, and you have the OG Masahiro Ito at your disposal, why on earth wouldn't you have him create more enemies? For almost all of the game you fight three different models. THREE. Two of which come with minor variations. How can you NOT use them sparingly if this is all you have?Yet even if there was more variety, with twenty enemies in under five minutes in cramped and pitch-black spaces the last thing I think about is the spooky ambiance of the place, or the narrative. If all you think about in a Silent Hill game is resource management and getting skilled at dodging, are you really playing a Silent Hill game?Extremely low enemy variety, yet a multitude of them around every corner, in a game that isn't optimally designed for combat, it became a chore for me. A dozen hours in I had to FORCE myself to keep playing. That's one of the worst things you can say about a game's most prominent mechanic, and seeing how truly great the remake started out, I think that's a damn shame.",

The setting is extremely bland and no crisis can be felt throughout. The weapons look extremely bad and poorly designed in terms of real weapon engineering. Furthermore, the game had me bored right from start to the abrupt finish I gave it after I uninstalled the game and requested a refund after the first mission and one multiplayer match. (I played about 2 hours of multiplayer in the beta and the game felt exactly the same on release.) Terrible game, dying series with developers and publishers not knowing what made the first games so great. Realistic weapons and clothing, over the top stories and cool set pieces that don't require robotic limbs. Example: Laying in a field with a patrol walking right past you in MW was more fun than the last 3 COD games combined.",

    "text": "to be honest i have not bought this game, but i went over to my friends house to try it out because i wasn't convinced i should buy it. i was really excited when i saw the opening videos, and when i was customizing my friends loadouts. after playing for 1 hour all my excitement was gone. i did not experience any balance issues or glitches. i didn't even experience any lag, but what i did experience was deja vu. it only took an hour for me to realize that i was playing the same game as black ops, as modern warfare 2, as world at war, as cod 4, and i will even go back as far as cod 2. It's the same game! the only big innovation the series has under it's belt is the perk system which made cod 4 one of the best multiplayer games i have ever played. zombies was introduced with waw but it isn't an innovation because it came out the same year that gears introduced horde mode. weapon customization also came with cod 4 but there have been other older franchises to use that in their games (example: socom series) once i got bored of multiplayer my friend and i played survival mode, which i really enjoyed. i feel like they did a good job on that, not an innovation but they definitely refined the horde gametype. there was some disappointment that came with survival mode though. i didn't understand why it was only 2 player, even on online co-op. zombies was 4 player, how come survival can't be 4 player as well? i wasn't a big fan of spec ops on mw 2, and they seemed very similar in mw 3. the last thing i was disappointed with was how short the campaign was, we beat in like 5 hours. we didn't even try to rush through it I'm sure someone could beat it under 5 hours which is sad. with how short the campaign was i feel like they should have cut it completely, along with the spec ops missions. instead they should have had a major focus on multiplayer. makes sense right? i mean they just came out with the elite service to track your stats. why even make singleplayer options? anyways i feel like with the focus on multiplayer they could have made survival 4 player co-op, and they could have added more multiplayer options such as guns, maps, camo, etc. but they will just make you spend $15 on that later. the only thing about this game that saved it from getting anything lower than a 4 is the fact that survival was fun. i think there needs to be a change in the cod formula. if activision read this they would think i'm crazy because economically it does not make sense, why change the formula for something that makes you billions of dollars? all i have to say is that they have lost my business and i will not buy another call of duty until they make some innovations. the only thing that can make that happen is competition. competition is excellent for the gaming industry, because it makes the consumer happy because developers are constantly trying to out due their counterpart. this leads to great games for consumers, and money circulating in the industry. every great dynasty has to fall, and eventually people will realize that $60 is a waste of money if it's basically the same game as last year. the same problem is happening with madden, people are starting to realize that there is no innovation with that game, and the game critics are finally showing it with their scores, and yet critics still rate call of duty games ****. the last thing i will say is for the call of duty fanboys. insanity- when someone does the same thing over and over while expecting a different result.",

    "text": "The original Dark Souls stands not only as one of the best games of the last generation, but perhaps one of the greatest games ever made. Its atmosphere, gameplay, and difficulty made it an experience unlike any other before it. In this regard, Dark Souls II had large shoes to fill. Thankfully, FromSoftware’s latest entry into the series successfully rekindles the magic of the first game by advancing its gameplay and accessibility. One excellent aspect of Dark Souls II is its gameplay. The Souls series is known for its impeccable mechanics, and Dark Souls II is no exception. Everything from swordplay to sorcery maintains its high level of detail and complexity. However, these mechanics have been greatly polished, allowing the gameplay experience to be far smoother. These refined controls are accompanied by the traditional and crippling difficulty of the series. Throughout a playthrough, a player will encounter seemingly insurmountable obstacles that test his or her desire to win. The game is also peppered with confrontations with opponents vastly superior in strength, size, and tenacity. To many people, this difficulty may seem tedious and unappealing. However, the difficulty is what makes the game special. Every failure is the player’s fault, and the game centers itself on learning from defeat. Some of the most exhilarating and fulfilling moments in gaming come from finally besting an enemy after hours of seeming defeat. The fulfillment felt from each victory makes Dark Souls II a remarkably satisfying game to play. On a technical level, Dark Souls II far surpasses its predecessor. The original Dark Souls struggled to maintain a decent frame rate, and at certain areas the game became nearly unplayable. Dark Souls II, however, is able to run smoothly, never once dropping below 30 frames per second. The improved frame rates, coupled with the reworked graphics, ensure that the game is the series’ most technically sound entry. These enhancements allow the difficulty of the game to stem from actual obstacles rather than unintended technical problems. The most interesting aspect of Dark Souls II is how it delivers its story. Rather than being presented directly to the player, the narrative is presented subtly. Players are dropped into a world with minimal background information and instructed to piece the big picture together themselves. The lore of the game comes from the enemies fought, locations visited, and items collected. This approach to a narrative makes the game world feel far more natural, as though it existed for thousands of years before you first enter it. And while the melancholy tale of the rise and fall of the kingdom is Drangleic is admittedly less interesting than that of the original Dark Souls, it is still a story worth uncovering. As a whole, Dark Souls II is superb. FromSoftware has succeeded again in making a punishing yet fulfilling game. The main problem with Dark Souls II, however, is that it doesn’t quite live up to its predecessor. While Dark Souls II is more accessible and easier to play, it feels more like a game and less like a true experience. The original Dark Souls was remarkable in both design and atmosphere. The creativity and enjoyably depressing nature of the original produced a remarkable experience unlike any game made before it. Dark Souls II does not live up to this mold. It tries very hard to rekindle the magic of its predecessor, but in doing so it fails to find its own identity. Dark Souls II is a better game, but it is not a better experience.",

The game introduces a rich narrative filled with emotional depth, complex character development, and stunning visuals that draw players into its beautifully crafted **** gameplay mechanics are refined, offering a seamless blend of brutal combat and intricate puzzles. The addition of new abilities and weapons enhances the combat experience, allowing for a variety of playstyles. The boss battles are particularly noteworthy, showcasing challenging encounters that require strategy and skill.Visually, Ragnarök is a feast for the eyes. The landscapes are breathtaking, from snow-covered mountains to lush forests, each area bursting with detail. The voice acting and soundtrack elevate the storytelling, immersing players in the emotional stakes of the characters' journeys.However, while the game excels in many areas, some players may find the pacing a bit uneven, with certain segments feeling drawn out. Additionally, there are moments where the narrative could have benefited from tighter editing.Overall, God of War Ragnarök is an extraordinary sequel that successfully expands upon its predecessor's legacy. With its compelling story, engaging gameplay, and stunning presentation, it stands as a must-play title for both fans of the series and newcomers alike.",

Actually, it's got some ambition, including levels and worlds not belonging to the main quest with side missions and mini games. The plot is darker which is welcomed because it weighs up the horrible corny characters. Also, the battle system is a little more diverse with the possibility to recruit monsters as a third party member. Although most revisions make this sequel better than the first game, FF13 is rotten at its core and can't be fixed. The characters are still flat, the environments still empty out all graphic surprises during the first gaming hour, the story line is still boring and worlds are still not as open as they used to be. This game is not a challenge, but merely time-consuming. What's challenging in this game is, for example, boring mini games which just takes time (like the clock anomaly) and difficult monsters (which you beat after hitting x through a bunch of battles to level up). As with the previous game, it makes a fabulous contrast to the superior quality of whatever FF game comes next.",

The second half of the game, however, is just lazy, rushed, terrible gameplay with no redeeming qualities. You basically run through dark hallways constantly re-using the same textures and enemies by yourself, because the MC Noctis got separated from his bros. It's not fun. For the half of the game that is fun, it's not great, just good. You have an illusion of a big world to explore, but if you go off the beaten path for even a moment you will run into invisible walls and such. You are not meant to explore this world, but stick to the main paths. The combat, honestly, is pretty bad in comparison to some rival RPGs, so that wouldn't be a big draw to keep me interested in the game. The fishing minigame is not very well done... it just kinda... blah in most of the things it attempts to do. For instance, there's this big emphasis on the car. Is it fun to drive the car? Nope. It pretty much drives itself. SO WHY? It's my opinion that the best games have a gameplay first mindset, but this game just makes how things look the priority. Why can't I jump on top of the hood of a car? There's an invisible wall there. Plastic lawn chairs are like cemented down, and can't be moved. The day to night cycle is so fast you can't do much before nightfall. You know what? Actually it's not half a \"good\" game, it's half a mediocre one. That makes it about a 3/10 by my math.

It looks like visual designs of weapons were handled by different parties and thrown in the game without communicating with one another. it leaves a sense of disconnect to see cartoony, over-colored plastic swords next to weapons whose designers were trying way to hard to make them look edgy and cool. Alot of the character writing is excellent, which is one of the few redeeming qualities of the game. And while the areas are absurdly recycled, they tend to be visually appealing.

    "text": "The humble beginning of what would become one of Nintendo's biggest flagship franchises. A fighting game curtesy of Kirby mastermind Masahiro Sakurai featuring an assortment of Nintendo characters. The concept alone was enough to ensure this would be a surefire hit. When compared to future games in the series, yeah there's not much reason to return to this game outside of nostalgia or wanting to see the roots of the series, but that doesn't mean the game still doesn't have worth. This is a fighting game featuring various Nintendo icons, both recognizable and more obscure. What set this game apart from other fighters (outside of the roster) was in its combat. Rather than traditionally pulling off a complicated string of button combos and directional inputs, the game focuses on two primary attack buttons, and hitting the analog stick in different directions in combination with the attack inputs to achieve different results. This set-up makes it very easy for beginners to ease into the mechanics, and even if you aren't very good at the game you can still stand a chance, and thus can make it more enjoyable than your average fighter. There are 12 characters total, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Aside from a couple of clone fighters, it's a well-varied roster combined with equally healthy number of stages that are all fun to fight on. The game overall is pretty light on content, especially in single player. You've got the traditional training mode and a single player arcade mode where you fight through a set series of battles. There's also Target Practice and Board the Platforms which can test the platforming and movesets of each character. While the single player offerings are fine enough, they certainly aren't the reason you go back to this game. Obviously, multiplayer is where SSB shines. If you've got four controllers and four friends, your in for some of the best multiplayer battles the N64 has to offer. There are free-for-alls, team battles, special battles, item customization. It's a really healthy offering. So, while I'll certainly recommend any other Smash Bros. game over this one, the original here is still a great game in its own right. For N64 owners and Smash players, it's a must own. If you can get past its dated exterior, you'll be in for a good time.",

The third thing is the fighting system. Most games have it where you focus with left trigger and then fight with the right trigger. Well, if you press left trigger then right, your guy just trows whatever. You have no focus on your enemies. Just press the right trigger and pray it hits something. This is very annoying when you are tying to save someone and you end up accidently hitting the person you are trying to save. When that happens, the person you are saving turns on you.

Though the 3rd person perspective may rob one of a deeply personal experience, I feel this series was never really about being in the shoes of the character. Rather, the player is more of a director than a gamer, telling Nathan Drake where to go, what to shoot, and letting Drake be Drake. But there are still those times where the player and Drake are experiencing the same confusion and hysteria, and these moments are truly a unique experience. In my opinion, the only real problem with this game is the slow beginning. This being the 3rd entry in the series, familiarity with the mechanics made me want to jump right in and run around and be my own guide. However, countless cut-scenes and moments of partial-control plague the beginning. That said, this is still a fantastic game.",

It would be a minor complaint if they werent EVERYWHERE completly runiing the atmosphere. Another point of critique is the very bad performance.

More like a tutorial coming directly from the developers instead from an story writer. It's mostly really awkward and somehwat childish. But well, i didnt buy X for the campaign so forget it. Overall, it's still a good X game but by far not the \"rebirth\" i was hoping for. It mostly seems like the budget was going into make things fancy then really thining things trough and maybe find new approaches.

    "text": "Pretty and well optimized, lots of drifting but it's generally responsive and rewarding. Lots of variety in handling from car to car and class to class, everything requires it's own approach and adjustments. The game forced me to play without a mini map in the campaign and I liked it so much I turned the minimap for good, since most hard turns have easily visible arrow indicators. No driver-cam, AI could be better, and some other little issues. Overall a decent game, but there's other racing games probably more worth the money. I notice other people had problems with spinning out of control when taking corners. I don't know if they were also using controllers, but for me the game defaulted to the triggers for the throttle and brakes, which is **** for obvious reasons. The handling improved immensely after I switched it to a and x.",

    "text": "A decently entertaining ride. Tomb Raider (2013) is a full-on reboot that sets up an entirely new origin story and introduces a new version of Lara Croft. And I have to say, this version of Lara is better than the overtly sexualized vixens in prior titles. The premise is fairly well set up. Your ship is sunk in a typhoon and you and other survivors are stranded on this mysterious island. Cliche? Sure. But it doesn't mean it's bad. It does a good job of setting up the atmosphere of the game. The graphics are extremely good, especially if you've got the hardware muscle to efficiently render the GPU-punishing TressFX feature (dynamic hair physics simulation). With TressFX, Lara's hair is arguably the best hair of any game. But I digress... The environments and atmospheric effects are top notch, and character models are well made. Particle and physics effects are also very good. Granted if you have the hardware to back it all up. Gameplay is... decent. The gunplay and stealth aspects are solid in their own right, but the presence of the hated quick-time events dampen the experience by a fairly significant margin, considering the over-abundance of QTE's in the game. In general though, Tomb Raider is a great reboot of the franchise that honestly improves upon it, but perhaps in order to appeal to the current mainstream gamers, quick-time events have made a comeback...",

However, the attractions, keyblade forms, and team attacks are all a lot of fun to use so I can't call them bad or anything. I heard some people don't like the game because it's easy, but in the end, what really matters, is if it's fun, and Kingdom Hearts III certainly is. The story is also really good, and the other side events are also a lot of fun. I wouldn't say the game is completely perfect, but the problems it has are totally overwritten by the good story, great gameplay, and everything else. KHIII is game of the year so far, no doubt.",

    "text": "Although the graphics were very impressive when this game came out, the latest release of Grand Theft Auto V on PS4, Xbox One and PC makes Grand Theft Auto IV almost obsolete. This game would definitely benefit from a remaster on modern platforms, but it's debatable if such an idea will come to fruition. It's still a fun game, but online is pretty much dead and don't expect as much content as GTA 5. A lot of people also criticized the game for lacking in content in comparison to older GTA games such as San Andreas and how most missions involve shooting people and lacking variety. What made this game great however is how impressive Rockstar did to reboot the series and give it a new identity. The result was a game that had some shortcomings, but it definitely impressed us by how modern it was. This game is worth playing if you are already sick of GTA 5 and want to try something different.",

The loading times for enemy battles are not a problem at all. It is almost like when you place chess against an AI, you need to allow the AI to compute what it will do. This down time gave me, at least, a little time to think of my next moves. Now, the game isn't that difficuly--due to restore points--but it takes a little bit of planning and thought. Again, the enemy AI time allows you to do this. It is a fun strategy game that shows continues to showcase how Nintendo platforms have the most original and unique games out. Enjoy!",

Characters act completely opposite to who they are and have developed into throughout the first game. This is all because the writer decided that a specific scenario must happen even if it goes completely against what that character would have done. I could go on and on but there are other youtube reviews out there that im sure break this down much better than i could. Its so sad that these characters and this story were forced to push a narrative that only the director Neil Druckman wanted. such a letdown from the first game in so many ways.
