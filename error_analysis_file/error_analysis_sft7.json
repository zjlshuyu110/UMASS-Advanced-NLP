No breakthrough bleeding (one of the biggest problems I had with the other pills) and it's made my periods so much lighter (I used to bleed through tampons and pads and now my period is way lighter). I haven't gotten pregt so I guess it's also doing what it's supposed to do lol. Another bonus: I used to get painful cystic acne on my chin whenever it was my time of the month and since beginning this pill I haven't had to deal with any acne whatsoever! The only problem I have with it is that I cry a bit more than I used to but I don't really mind.",

After countless ED visits specialists scans blood work I was diagnosed with Gastroparesis. I asked for the same medicine I had when I was pregt with her (Reglan) and if I’m being honest this drug helped me so much. It emptied my stomach rather quickly so food didn’t linger and it helped with nausea as well. To many people struggling with gastroparesis this drug did help. BUT. after being on it for so long I was suddenly admitted into the ED for Acute Dyskensia. This drug became a nightmare really quick. I couldn’t control the movements in my mouth or jaw my jaw was clenching and my tongue seemed as if it was trying to force its way into the back of my throat. I will never take this drug again but am thankful for the temporary relief it provided. It has been Black Boxed by the FDA for Tardive Dyskensia. Beware. Stay informed stay safe.",

I bought this because it was recommended by a friend and I didn't bother to read recent reviews. From what i've seen from the comments it seems as if this product didn't cause the intense itching and burning until recent years. Last night I inserted my first dose ( I got the cream one) put a panty liner in and went to bed I was completely fine no issues next day my YI seems to be starting to get much better so tonight I had my second dose used it around 1:30am and at 4:00am I woke up to my coochie itching so bad it felt like fire ants until I read these comments. I panicked so I laid down and the burning and itching is starting 2 subside as i type. The itch cream works though. I am going to take the 3rd dose because the product works you just have to bare the awful fiery pain",

I don’t have severe acne I suffer with breakouts that appear out of the blue around my mouth mostly and sometimes on my cheeks. This medication for me is extremely helpful if used correctly. When I first started taking it I experienced the side effects of nausea headaches vomiting etc but this was only because I was not taking it correctly. For me it was imperative to ensure I had food in my stomach and to take it regularly. This was everyday at the same time preferably after food. But when I followed this regime my cyst like pimples cleared and I only get the occasional tiny white head. However if I forget to take it even for one day my skin will react causing pimples again. My doctor did recommend that I not stay on this medication for longer than 3months but when I expressed my reluctancy to go off it he prescribed it again. My advice is definitely always take this with food!",

So people saying it stops it right in its track are wrong. But it does help for the healing time. In 5 days its gone. Still better then the 7-9 days i used to go through before.

Now I’m on 20mg in the morning 20 mg in the afternoon. It helps my concentration and ADHD issues for maybe the first 2 hours or less after each dose but then from there it causes terrible anxiety depression. It makes things worse than actually helping when it starts wearing off (which is very quickly). Overall I don't like Focalin at all. It not only comes with mental side effects like I mentioned but also physical side effects as well such as: shortness of breath rapid heart beat constant feeling like I have to urinate but can’t fatigue etc. It’s been over 3 months and it hasn’t helped my ADHD consistently or effectively anywhere close to stabilizing and treating it. Please consider other ADHD meds before going with Focalin for you / your child’s ADHD problems. It certainly hasn’t been the answer for me.",

I've been reading other comments about headaches and I can agree that I have had headaches every other night but they weren't bad. I could still fall asleep. I am changing to a different pill because I didn't like how I gained weight on this pill. I gained 10 pounds at least and I've been getting heavier.
