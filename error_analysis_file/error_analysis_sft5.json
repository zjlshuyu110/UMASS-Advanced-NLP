I wasn’t able to relax eat sleep I would go 2 or more days without sleeping and I would throw up a lot. I got prescribed Zoloft at 25mg for 2 weeks then up it to 50mg. The first week or two was pretty horrible worse anxiety rapid heart beat insomnia diarrhea but no nausea. At about 2 weeks in I had one day where all of a sudden my whole body relaxed I was calm and I could think properly…. I felt normal again! Over the next few weeks I upped it to 75mg when I started my masters program because I was getting some anxiety/panic but nothing like it was. I have zero side effects from the meds and every time I increased the dose I had a couple symptoms but no where near like how they were in the beginning. I combined it with CBT and it’s a life changing I’m successful confident and laughing again.",
