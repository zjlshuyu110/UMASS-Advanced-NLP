What appeared to come about was depression mostly. When I started 150mg buproprion HCL XL within 48 hrs I felt more energy more activated emotions less fog. It caused me to be more agitated and angry at first but I knew it was because I was coming from complete numbness to actually having some feelings. I am now a month in and I feel happy about where I am with my mood. I say definitely give it a chance especially if you are not a fan of SSRIs. Give it a few weeks and log your feelings. Being on this is far better than where I was in my depression. I wanted to share my experience and feelings because it has given me some hope and I want to share that with others.",

Due to the cost of what I was spending on Abreva I turned to more natural remedies and in doing that I usually only get 1-2 outbreaks a year. I don’t know if the rate of how often I was/am getting them is related but seems a bit like a coincidence. Instead I now use ice when I can feel it tingle: to help with swelling and I use a baking soda/water mix followed by a skin-safe tea tree oil mix. This new process has helped my cold sores last about 3 days total: from tingling to disappearing. I do not touch Abreva anymore.",

Junel helped a lot but I was getting annoyed with taking pills. For the past 3 years Mirena has made my periods 11 full days with only 10 days between each period. With this I have had horrible nausea cramping and insane mood swings/depression. Along with this I have gained 20 pounds even though I work out intensely 4-5 times a week and eat relatively healthily. I kept on it because everyone said this was an “adjustment period” but I’ve had enough and am switching to a new pill in a month and getting it removed. I really don’t recommend this for anyone especially younger women as it has had a horrible effect on my mental health. I didn’t get pregt so it worked in that aspect but ruined every other part of my life.",
