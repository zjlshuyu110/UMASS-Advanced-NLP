Rescue inhaler is not enough but have other medications that are quite effective including Combivent. There are many interactions and I have been told by others that even genetics can cause adverse reactions with this medication.

No problems before taking Entresto with amlodipine-benazepril. In 6 months I had congestive HF twice in 3 weeks then 4 weeks later! I asked if I could go back to my original meds  my doctor said he I'm far better off with Entresto. How will we know if its my heart that's failing or Entresto causing this if we never go back to my old meds to see if things return to normal ? My echocardiogram was 20/25 before Entresto a flat 20 on Entresto for 5 months. That test was one year apart so I was on Entresto for the last 5 months before the test. They said the difference from 25/20 to a flat 20 was not much of a change. Why the fluid build up? Now I'm taking diuretics for the fluid. I'm also on carvedilol which I was on before Entresto ) Would the change in BP cause or be part of the cause for fluid retention? Any answers?",

In addition it was difficult for the doctor to order tests to measure blood levels. Look for information and valproic acid only protects from mania and ''can help with depression'' but it does not treat it I am from the depressive pole so it is not effective for me. She never let me stop taking valproic acid so I changed my psychiatrist and the new one put me on lamotrigine and risperidone. I changed risperidone to quetiapine and finally stopped it. In the year that I have been taking lamotrigine I have not had mania or depression and only occasional anxiety due to stressful situations which is normal.
